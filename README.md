# AoC 2020 

Solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 problems go here.

I'm using Rust this year, as a way to brush up on the language and use it for more
than just a random toy once in a while. Learning the more common data manipulation 
methods will help in building out further projects later.

The codebase makes liberal use of the
[`cargo-aoc`](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) crate and Cargo runtime for
running the input and problem samples.
